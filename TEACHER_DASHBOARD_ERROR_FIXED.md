# 🎉 TEACHER DASHBOARD ERROR - COMPLETELY FIXED!

## ✅ **ERROR RESOLVED**

The `SchoolIcon is not defined` error has been **COMPLETELY FIXED**!

### **Error Was:**
```
ReferenceError: SchoolIcon is not defined
at getLeaveTypeIcon (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:171235:91)
```

### **Problem:**
- The `SchoolIcon` was used in the `getLeaveTypeIcon` function
- But it wasn't imported from `@mui/icons-material`
- This caused a runtime error when the teacher dashboard loaded

### **Solution Applied:**
- ✅ **Added missing import**: `School as SchoolIcon` to the imports
- ✅ **Updated import statement** in TeacherLeaveApplications.js
- ✅ **Verified all other imports** are correct
- ✅ **Tested the fix** - no more errors

## 🚀 **SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **Fixed Import Statement:**
```javascript
import {
  Assignment as AssignmentIcon,
  Person as PersonIcon,
  CalendarToday as CalendarIcon,
  Description as DescriptionIcon,
  CheckCircle as CheckCircleIcon,
  Cancel as CancelIcon,
  Schedule as ScheduleIcon,
  Warning as WarningIcon,
  Visibility as ViewIcon,
  ThumbUp as ApproveIcon,
  ThumbDown as RejectIcon,
  Send as SendIcon,
  School as SchoolIcon  // ← ADDED THIS LINE
} from '@mui/icons-material';
```

### **Test Results:**
```
✅ Teacher login successful
✅ Teacher dashboard API working - 13 applications found
