# TO (Training Officer) Navigation Fixes - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Menu Text Issues**
**Problem**: TO navigation items had truncated text
- "Student" instead of "Student Management"
- "Leave " instead of "Leave Applications"
- "Library" instead of "Library Books"
- "Book" instead of "Book Requests"
- "Store " instead of "Store Inventory"
- "Requests" instead of "Store Requests"

**Solution**: Fixed all navigation text in `DashboardLayout.js`

### 2. **Route Path Mismatches**
**Problem**: Navigation paths didn't match actual route definitions
- Navigation pointed to `/dashboard/users` but route was `/dashboard/to/students`
- Navigation pointed to `/dashboard/leave-applications` but route was `/dashboard/to/leave-applications`

**Solution**: Updated navigation paths to match actual routes

### 3. **Missing Component Wrapper**
**Problem**: TO Student Management needed proper wrapper component
**Solution**: Created `TOStudentManagementWrapper.js` component

### 4. **Route Definitions**
**Problem**: Some routes were missing or incorrectly defined
**Solution**: Updated `Dashboard.js` with proper TO routes

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `/client/src/components/common/DashboardLayout.js`
```javascript
to: [
  { text: 'Student Management', icon: <PeopleIcon />, path: '/dashboard/to/students' },
  { text: 'Leave Applications', icon: <AssignmentIcon />, path: '/dashboard/to/leave-applications' },
  { text: 'Library Books', icon: <BookIcon />, path: '/dashboard/to/library' },
  { text: 'Book Requests', icon: <RequestIcon />, path: '/dashboard/library/requests' },
  { text: 'Store Inventory', icon: <InventoryIcon />, path: '/dashboard/to/store' },
  { text: 'Store Requests', icon: <RequestIcon />, path: '/dashboard/store/requests' },
],
```

### 2. `/client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`
- Added proper TO route imports
- Updated TO routes with correct paths
- Added fallback routes for navigation compatibility

### 3. `/client/src/components/to/TOStudentManagementWrapper.js`
- Created new wrapper component for TO Student Management
